             I adopted Omelette while I was living in Malta.<br>
             He was very good company, while I was feeling homesick.<br>
             Omelette's favourite spot in Malta was the balcony.<br>
             He used to bask in the Maltese sun for hours, with some snack breaks. <br>
             Now he is basically doing the same, but in Vienna.

           Since I work full time, I wanted to get a buddy for Omelette.<br>
           Originally I didn't want another long haired cat, because the fur is everywhere! <br>
           But then a friend of mine sent me a link to an adoption site.<br>
           They had the most beautiful little cat, with gorgeous eyes.<br>
           Those eyes are very special, because they don't work. Pepper is blind.<br>
           She gets around just fine though, and only occasionally bumps into things.<br>
